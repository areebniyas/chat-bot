# Chatbot Project

This project is a chatbot application built using LangChain and LangGraph. It supports maintaining conversational history and multi-language responses using the OpenAI API. The chatbot can switch between conversation threads, apply different templates, and manage conversation history efficiently.

## Features

- **Conversational Memory**: Maintains chat history and differentiates between user sessions.
- **Multi-Language Support**: The chatbot can respond in different languages based on user input.
- **Custom Templates**: Includes configurable templates for different chatbot personalities (e.g., pirate, assistant).
- **State Management**: Utilizes LangGraph's state and memory management for effective conversation handling.
- **Message Trimming**: Manages and trims conversation history to stay within token limits.
- **Streaming Mode**: Supports streaming responses for real-time interactions.

## Tech Stack
